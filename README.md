# UNIFESP body part classification

## Description
Kaggle competition classification of medical images of different body parts. To do so, a dataset of 1740 images belonging to 22 different labels was available to train and evaluate machine learning models. This project allows the training of a pre-trained Resnet-50 model for multi-label classification.
